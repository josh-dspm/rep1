The goal of this product is to accelerate the process of building eCommerce Storefronts while providing enough architectural groundwork and best practice examples to ensure that customers are set for success when they customize the application and develop their own features.\nAlokai Connect's orchestration layer abstracts the complexity of connecting multiple third-party services in the frontend by providing a single API allowing to access all of them. We provide an ecosystem of ready-to-use integrations with e-commerce backends, headless CMSs, search, and payment solutions, as well as an integration framework that allows companies to easily integrate anything else.\nBoth products are tied together with Unified Data Layer - our own data model that abstracts the underlying API's and workflows and makes the storefront completely independent from any technology.

If you are looking for a highly visible and strategic individual contributor role and want to make a big impact in a fast-growing, dynamic company, this is an excellent fit for you!\n\n\nWhat do we expect you to have?\n\nExperience: Minimum of 3 years in product management, with prior demonstrated experience as software engineer, ideally software engineer.\n\nIf you are an experienced software engineer or developer advocate, with a strong business understanding, eager to move to a product position as next step in your career, your profile will be interesting for us as well!\n\nB2B/SaaS Products: A track record of managing B2B/SaaS products.\nExperience with building developer tools either as a creator, manager or contributor\nExperience with at least one of modern frontend frameworks like Vue.js, React, Angular etc.\nData Analysis: Demonstrated use of data to make key business decisions.\nOperational Excellence: Hands-on experience in product operations, including customer feedback analysis.\nCommunication: Excellent communication skills both within a team and in customer relations. Fluency in English is mandatory.\nAttitude & Approach: A proactive mindset of 'How we can make this better' in problem-solving, combined with a 'Growing as a human being' approach.\n\nSharing our values: \n\n\nVibe - you say what does not fit.
